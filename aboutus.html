                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>BitoGx, our Ex-Guildmaster, created Baguette on November 6, 2022. But aftertime, he decide to quit the game and put Reykori as the Guildmaster.
                <br>
                <br>
                At first, we are just a small guild with only 4 member.
                <br>
                But now, we have 30+ member on the game, and its becoming more lively ever since.
                <br>
                <br>
                Because the main guild is on max capacity, we have decide to create 2 guild branch called Baguette A and Baguette B.
                <br>
                Which is why we are currently recruiting new member on this website.
